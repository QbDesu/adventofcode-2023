## About the alternate solutions

For part 2 an exhaustive iteration over all possible combinations is much slower than mathematically calculating the result. The solution in `part2.py` is the much faster mathematical solution. The solution in `part2-bruteforce.py` is the slower brute force solution.

For part 1 however, the mathematical solution is a little slower than the brute force solution. The solution in `part1.py` is the faster brute force solution. The solution in `part1-math.py` is the slower mathematical solution.
